# CircuitCalculator
Desktop program for calculating resources for GT circuits (GTNH modpack)

- Currently supporting all circuits from LV to IV
- Some circuits have alternative receipts (can be switched with "High-Tier Circuits" option)
- Circuits which has previous tier circuits in their recipts can be decomposed to components recursively 

## All circuit available for now:

  - Electronic Circuit
  - Integrated Logic Circuit
  - Good Electronic Circuit
  - Good Integrated Circuit
  - Advanced Circuit
  - Integrated Processor
  - Processor Assembly
  - Workstation
  - Mainframe
  - Nanoprocessor
  - Nanoprocessor Assembly
  - Quantumprocessor
  - Quantumprocessor Assembly
  - Elite Nanocomputer
