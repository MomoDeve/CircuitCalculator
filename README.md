# CircuitCalculator
Desktop program for calculating resources for GT circuits (GTNH modpack)

- Currently supporting all circuits from LV to LuV
- Some circuits have alternative receipts (can be switched with "High-Tier Circuits" option)
- Circuits which has previous tier circuits in their recipts can be decomposed to components recursively 
- items can be showed in stacks if you are planning massive production

## All circuit available for now:

  - Electronic Circuit
  - Integrated Logic Circuit
  - Good Electronic Circuit
